    // TRANSFER MECHANISM //////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    ///  destroyed (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any
    ///  transfers may occur without emitting `Transfer`. At the time of any transfer,
    ///  the "approved taker" is implicitly reset to the zero address.

    ///  set for the first time, reaffirmed by setting the same value, or setting to
    ///  a new value. The "approved taker" is the zero address if nobody can take the
    ///  deed now or it is an address if that address can call `takeOwnership` to attempt
    ///  taking the deed. Any change to the "approved taker" for a deed SHALL cause
    ///  Approve to emit. However, an exception, the Approve event will not emit when
    ///  Transfer emits, this is because Transfer implicitly denotes the "approved taker"
    ///  is reset to the zero address.

    ///  setting the zero address. You may `approve` any number of times while
    ///  the deed is assigned to you, only the most recent approval matters. Emits
    ///  an Approval event.
    /// @dev Throws if `msg.sender` does not own deed `_deedId` or if `_to` ==
    ///  `msg.sender` or if `_deedId` is not a valid deed.
    /// @param _deedId The deed for which you are granting approval
